## What is this about?

I have Fuji Electric AC units at home that I wanted to become integrated with my smart home network. Unfortunatelly, those are old-school devices with IR and wired remotes and no WiFi. 

## This repository

I reverse engineered the serial protocol between wire remote controller and the AC unit by hooking up in between the AC unit and wired remote controller. This repository contains code that is the result of that work.

## Compatibility

This software was tested against RSG09LUCA and RSG12LUCA and should interface well with Fuji Electric/Fujitsu Air conditioners that are using UTY-RNNUM, UTY-RNNXM  or similar controllers.
